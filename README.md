#Scripts for SARS-CoV-2 Interactive Data Visualization
This repository contains Python scripts that provide interactive visualizations of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data. The visualizations are created using Plotly, a popular graphing library for making interactive plots.

Overview of Scripts 
1- The first script processes data to display lineage distribution over time. specifically highlighting the count and percentage of different virus lineages over time. 



##You can install the necessary libraries using pip e.g.,
pip install pandas plotly

Usage
Place your  data in the root of this repository. The data should be in a tab-separated format (TSV) and named your_data_file.csv.
Run the script with the following command:
bash
Copy code
python visualize_lineages.py
Data Format
The script expects a TSV file with the following key columns:

Collection date: The date of sample collection.
Lineage: The identified lineage of the SARS-CoV-2 from each sample.
Ensure your data adheres to this format to avoid processing errors.
